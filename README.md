# flux-example

A simple "shopping cart" application that serves as a [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/flux-overview.html) example.

In an effort to keep things simple, no additional Flux related libraries are used, except for the [default Dispatcher module](https://github.com/facebook/flux) provided by Facebook.

## Usage
```
npm install
npm start
```
`webpack-dev-server` should be running the app on [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
